                <p>
                    I went on two immersion trips to CI: in Apr 2025 and Mar 2024. Here's some photos and observations. A cool track to set
                    the mood:

                    The weather is quite brutal unless you're from Arizona or Qatar or something.

                <p>That's 91F with a "feels like" of 104F for my friends from the US.</p>
                <p>
                    Most indoors spaces have air conditioning on full blast, literally as low as it will go. Most rooms have the same type
                    and size aircon device. This has a funny side-effect: smaller rooms are way cooler than larger ones. Spaces without air
                    conditioning, like open markets or restaurant terraces, have plentiful fans blowing every which way.

                    Many smaller streets have extremely bumpy sand roads, with rundown buildings and random piles of stones or trash on the
                    sides:

                <p>This is in stark contrast with bridges, highways, churches, and other quite new and well-built infra, often <a href="https://english.news.cn/20240110/27706eaf1e4242638a0a98209ef56e11/c.html">bankrolled by China</a>:</p>

                    The most interesting and valuable part of our trips is "going to market", talking to the customers. The markets we visit
                    are colorful and chaotic. You got all kinds of produce, shoes and plastic crap:

                <p>Meat sellers look more brutal with their cardboard soaked in fat and blood:</p>

                    Here's how the chickens get delivered. The chicken poop smell is horrible. And the dummies don't even try to make a run
                    for it when left unattended :(

                <p>I don't know what it is, but I find merchants sitting in the middle of their merch really pelasing to look at:</p>

                    Best shoes are flip-flops. And whenever you're not walking, you sit barefoot for better ventilation. Here's a fish store
                    boss and a shoe salesman demonstrating these principles:

                    The biggest market in West Africa is the <a href="https://g.co/kgs/XB82SD1">Adjamé Dabananni Market</a>. It spans
                    multiple blocks, with several multi-story buildings. Alleyways are deep enough that there's no cell reception.

                    Food can be rough. Most dishes are a very dry or close to burned meat or fish, with a high-carb side-dish of rice,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheke">attieke</a> or best-case sweet potatoes. Many dishes are also spicy as
                    fuck. Don't touch the green sauce. There's not enough protein and close to zero veggies. Here's an office meal and a restaurant meal.

                    Salvation comes in the form of recommendations from foreigners, like the US civil-military relations reps that stayed in
                    our hotel. Here's <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ht1v8AGj84GaHXpK7">Marrouche</a>, an ok lebanese place, and the
                    ultra-sleek <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/sQwi2S7Wif67A9Lx9">Pikado</a> bakery:

                </div>
                <p>I don't know how to end this. I'll just say that visiting West Africa is a surreal and super useful experience. If you're from the US or the EU, and you're serving WA users, you absolutely <i>have to</i> to visit.</p>
